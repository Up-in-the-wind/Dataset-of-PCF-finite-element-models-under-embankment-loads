# Dataset-of-PCF-finite-element-models-under-embankment-loads
This dataset includes 5050 finite element models of pile composite foundation (PCF) with varying embankment loads and geological conditions. The above model is based on the Abaqus platform. This dataset can provide data support for machine learning-based research on the mechanical behavior of PCF.
